# What is Programming?

`Computer programming` is the process of performing a particular computation, usually by designing and building an executable computer program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms. 

`Coding` is a part of programming that deals with writing codes that a machine can understand. Programming is a process that creates programs that involve the ratification of codes. Coding requires basic knowledge of programming skills without any software tools.

`Programming` is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++.

`Programming` is a tool to solve engineering problems in the real world consider you automating human labour. Our job is to eliminate human labour and replace it with machines. We can do this by creating programs that can automate human labour. That is one purpose of programming. Imagine if we got a huge mathematical problem set which we need to solve ... for humans it will take a long time to solve it but for computers it will take a few seconds. That is the power of `programming` and `computation`.

`Programming` is a process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++ otherwise known as `coding`. Programming falls under many categories. For example you configuring an alarm for yourself to wake up each day that is a example of programming it is also programming your mind to follow that routine.

As a `Computer Scientist` i use programming daily in my life to solve mathematical equations using `Python` or `Matlab`. I maintain software hundreds of people use daily including my personal website `ADGSTUDIOS`. I automate processes in businesses and also use Artifical Intelligence to get the job done.
There is some software i use in my life that many contributors created on GitHub. For example i play emulation games on PC. I play Nintendo Switch games on my PC now a large group of people around the world wrote and contribute to that project even i can go there and make modifications if there are issues i am having with that software. That is the power of `programming` and `open source`. The source code is open for everyone to see and modify.

You can also engineer `Hardware` gadgets to help you accomplish tasks such as robots, drones etc.

In conclusion, any job specification you create and implement is considered programming.

# How to get started with programming?
Now as mentioned above programming is not just coding. Research your gadget and see what it is capable of.

For example: You can program your `Samsung Phone` to process `instructions` when a `milestone` is reached

![](/static/img/Bixby-Routines-stitched_3.webp)

In this case `If` the `Time` is `01:00-09:00` and `Charging status` = `Not charging` and `Battery Level` = `Below 40%`

Then
`Medium Power Saving Mode` = `On`

As you can see you can program your phone to do a task when a milestone is reached. This is a simple example of programming with zero coding.

Let us say you want to do coding and build applications to help you in your daily life.

You should get a proper grounding of `Computer Science` and `Mathematics` before you start programming. You can start with `Python` or `JavaScript` as they are easy to learn and you can build applications with them. You can also learn `C++` or `C#` if you want to build `Desktop Applications` or `Games`.

You can also learn `Java` or `Kotlin` if you want to build `Android Applications`.

Learning `HTML` and `CSS` is also a good idea as you can build `Web Applications` with them.

For getting started i believe you should learn programming princples and build mini applications to get a feel of programming. There are many resources online to get started with programming. I will list some of them below.

## Resources to learn programming
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)
- [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/)
- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
- [Code.org](https://code.org/)
- [CodeHS](https://codehs.com/)
- [CodeCombat](https://codecombat.com/)
- [Code Monkey](https://www.playcodemonkey.com/)
- [Code Avengers](https://www.codeavengers.com/)

Write your own code and build applications to get a feel of programming. You can also join online communities to get help and learn from others. I will list some of them below.

## Online Communities to learn programming
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)
- [Quora](https://www.quora.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)

Start with the basics and build your way up. You can also learn `Artificial Intelligence` and `Machine Learning` to build applications that can solve problems for you. You can also learn `Data Science` to build applications that can process data for you.

## Sample Applications to build
- Calculator
- To Do List
- Database Dashboard
- Data Visualisation Dashboard
- Weather App
- Chat App
- Blog App
- Social Media App
- Ecommerce App
- Music App
- Video App

## Getting recognised for your work
- Build and publish your projects on GitHub
- Write papers and publish them on ResearchGate
- Create YouTube videos and publish them on YouTube
- Create a website and publish it on `Netlify`/`Heroku`

To date i think i have reached to over `100000` people over my website across the world.
The more people you reach the greater your impact will be and opportunities will come your way.

## Conclusion
You can do the `self-taught` route which I did supplement your skills with certifications and build coding projects on GitHub otherwise you can do a `Computer Science Degree` but note you will learn just the theory and not the practical side of programming. You will need to learn the practical side of programming on your own. People these days after doing a Computer Science Degree are not employable as they do not have the practical skills to get the job done. They are just good at theory and not practical. What these guys do after their degree they normally take one year and study programming on their own and then they get a job. I have seen this happen many times in my life. Some even go to `Bootcamps` to learn programming. Start early and learn programming on your own. Build projects and release it to the world. Experiment and learn from your mistakes. You will get there. I believe in you. While in University grab opportunities dont waste time.
While on holiday screw the holiday and grind. Spend time programming and building projects. Apply for a holiday internship. Become an entrepreneur if you are building quality stuff and know your potential. Some people are lucky the employer they work for they get funded to do courses in programming and learn from coworkers. I program as a hobby and i do it consistantly that is why i am good at it.
