# NGINX Flask server

## Introduction

This is a tutorial on how to set up a Flask server with NGINX. 

Let us denote an `App`. This `App` is a Flask application that we want to serve with NGINX. The `App` is located in the directory `/home/user/app`.

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "<h1 style='color:blue'>Hello There!</h1>"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
```

The `App` is running on port `5000`. We want to serve this `App` with NGINX on port `80`.

Sometimes Linux distros come with a firewall. We need to open port `80` for NGINX to work and `5000` for the `App` to work.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 5000
```

You may visit the `App` at `http://localhost:5000`

## Installing Gunicorn

Gunicorn is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX. It is a pre-fork worker model. The Gunicorn server is broadly compatible with various web frameworks, simply implemented, light on server resources, and fairly speedy.

```bash
pip install gunicorn
```

### Running the app with Gunicorn

```bash
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

Now that we have Gunicorn installed, we can run the `App` with Gunicorn. We can visit the `App` at `http://localhost:5000`

## Setting up a systemd service

We can set up a systemd service to run the `App` with Gunicorn. This will allow us to run the `App` as a service.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/app.service
```

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Gunicorn instance to serve app
After=network.target

[Service]
User=user
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/home/user/app
Environment="PATH=/home/user/app/venv/bin"
ExecStart=gunicorn --workers 3 --bind localhost:5000 app:app

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Starting the service

You can start the service with the following command.

```bash
sudo systemctl start app
```

### Enabling the service

You can enable the service with the following command. This will start the service on boot.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable app
```

### Checking the status of the service

You can check the status of the service with the following command.

```bash
sudo systemctl status app
```

### Stopping the service

```bash
sudo systemctl stop app
```

## Installing NGINX

To install NGINX, run the following command.

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```

### Configuring NGINX

Using the nano editor, open the file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

With nano editor, press `Ctrl + W` and type `server_name`. This will take you to the line `server_name _;`. Replace `_` with `localhost`. This will allow you to visit the `App` at `http://localhost`

```bash
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;

    location / {    
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
    }
}
```

### Restarting NGINX

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Checking the status of NGINX

```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

### Checking the NGINX configuration

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

Now that we have NGINX installed and configured, we can visit the `App` at `http://localhost`

What is missing is the SSL certificate. We can use Let's Encrypt to get a free SSL certificate.

## Installing Certbot

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

### Getting the SSL certificate for the domain example.com

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d example.com -d www.example.com
```

### Renewing the SSL certificate

```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

### Checking the status of the SSL certificate

```bash
sudo certbot certificates
```

### Checking the SSL certificate expiration date

```bash
sudo certbot certificates | grep Expiry
```

### Checking the SSL certificate renewal date

```bash
sudo certbot certificates | grep Renew
```

But now we have an issue the certificate will expire in 90 days. We need to renew the certificate every 90 days. We can automate this process with a cron job.

## Setting up a cron job

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

```bash
0 0 1 * * sudo certbot renew
```

This will run the command `sudo certbot renew` every first day of the month at midnight.

## Conclusion

We have set up a Flask server with NGINX. We have also set up a cron job to renew the SSL certificate every 90 days. This will allow you to run your website on a cloud server for free or even a local server.
